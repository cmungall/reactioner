|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|ca:|catalytic activity|Catalysis of a biochemical reaction at physiological temperatures. In biologically catalyzed reactions, the reactants are known as substrates, and the catalysts are naturally occurring macromolecular substances known as enzymes. Enzymes possess specific binding sites for substrates, and are usually composed wholly or largely of protein, but RNA that ha| catalytic activity (ribozyme) is often also regarded as enzymatic.|||
|GO:0004133|glycogen debranching enzyme activity|Catalysis of the cleavage of branch points in branched glycogen polymers.|||
|GO:0009975|cyclase activity|Catalysis of a ring closure reaction.|||
|GO:0016491|oxidoreductase activity|Catalysis of an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction, a reversible chemical reaction in which the oxidation state of an atom or atoms within a molecule is altered. One substrate acts as a hydrogen or electron donor a|d becomes oxidized, while the other acts as hydrogen or electron acceptor and becomes reduced.||EC:1|
|GO:0016740|transferase activity|Catalysis of the transfer of a group, e.g. a methyl group, glycosyl group, acyl group, phosphorus-containing, or other groups, from one compound (generally regarded as the donor) to another compound (generally regarded |s the acceptor). Transferase is the systematic name for any enzyme of EC class 2.||EC:2|
|GO:0016787|hydrolase activity|Catalysis of the hydrolysis of various bonds, e.g. C-O, C-N, C-C, phosphoric anhydride bonds, e|c. Hydrolase is the systematic name for any enzyme of EC class 3.||EC:3|
|GO:0016829|lyase activity|Catalysis of the cleavage of C-C, C-O, C-N and other bonds by other means than by hydrolysis or oxidation, or conversely adding a group to a double bond. They differ from other enzymes in that two substrates are involved in one reaction direction, but only one in the other direction. When acting on the single substrate, a molecule is eliminated and |his generates either a new double bond or a new ring.||EC:4|
|GO:0016853|isomerase activity|Catalysis of the geometric or structural changes within one molecule. Isomerase is the systemat|c name for any enzyme of EC class 5.||EC:5|
|GO:0016874|ligase activity|Catalysis of the joining of two substances, or two groups within a single molecule, with the conco|itant hydrolysis of the diphosphate bond in ATP or a similar triphosphate.||EC:6|
|GO:0032451|demethylase activity|Catalysis of the removal of a methyl group from a substrate.|||
|GO:0061783|peptidoglycan muralytic activity|A catalytic activity that contributes to the degradation of peptidoglycan.|||
|GO:0140096|catalytic activity, acting on a protein|Catalytic activity that acts to modify a protein.|||
|GO:0140097|catalytic activity, acting on DNA|Catalytic activity that acts to modify DNA.|||
|GO:0140098|catalytic activity, acting on RNA|Catalytic activity that acts to modify RNA.|||
|GO:0004134|4-alpha-glucanotransferase activity|Catalysis of the transfer of a segment of a (1->4)-alpha-D-glucan to a new 4-position in an acceptor, which may be glucose or (1->4)-alpha-D-glucan.||EC:2.4.1.25|MetaCyc:AMYLOMALT-RXN|MetaCyc:RXN-1828|Met|Cyc:RXN-9023
|GO:0004135|amylo-alpha-1,6-glucosidase activity|Catalysis of the hydrolysis of (1->6)-alpha-D-glucosidic branch linkages in glycogen phosphorylase limit dextrin. Limit dextrin is the highly branched core that remains after exhaustive treatment of glycogen with glycogen phosphorylase. It is formed because these enzymes cannot hydrolyze the (1->6) glycosidic linkages present.||EC:3.2.1.33|MetaCyc:3.2.1.33-RXN
|GO:0019156|isoamylase activity|Catalysis of the hydrolysis of alpha-(1,6)-D-glucosidic branch linkages in glycogen, amylopect|n and their beta-limits dextrins.||EC:3.2.1.68|MetaCyc:3.2.1.68-RXN|MetaCyc:RXN-12280|MetaCyc:RXN-14380
